# Greedy Approach

Greedy approach ek algorithmic strategy hai jisme:

> Har step par locally best (sabse acha) choice li jaati hai,
> is expectation me ki ye choices milkar globally optimal (final best) result dengi.

Simple words me:

👉 “Jo iss moment me best lag raha hai, wahi choose karo — future ki tension mat lo.”

Greedy algorithm:

- Har step par best immediate decision leta hai
- Future reconsideration nahi karta
- Backtracking nahi karta
- Ek baar decision le liya toh change nahi hota
